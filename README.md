Implementation of Factorial Hidden Markov Model (FHMM) for discrete-valued observation case (eg. words).
Features:
* New variational algorithm for learning the parameters of FHMM for discreted-valued observation cases
* Faster training by multi-threading
* Faster training by online learning (training in mini-batches)
